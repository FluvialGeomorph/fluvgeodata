# fluvgeodata 2025.04.12

## Major changes
* Created this new R data package with the purpose of storing all testing data for the fluvgeo R package. The creation of this package will allow for the streamlining of fluvgeo to better meet CRAN publishing requirements. 
* Added all existing testing from the fluvgeo/inst/exdata folder. 
* Added test data for shiny apps to the ./inst/extdata/shiny folder. This folder will support the inclusion of new fluvgeo functions that are intended to be used in shiny applications.
